# GCD_Project Overview

The script "run_analysis.R" does the following:
<ol>
<li>Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set called "data1".</li>
<li>Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement to a data set called "data2".</li>
<li>Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in a data set called "data3".</li>
<li>Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names in a data set called "data4".</li>
<li>From the data4, creates "data5", independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.</li>
<li>Prints data5</li>
</ol>

IMPORTANT: Need to load "dplyr" package before running script.
