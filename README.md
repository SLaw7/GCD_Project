# GCD_Project Overview

The script "run_analysis.R" does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set called "data1"
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement to a data set called "data2". 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in a data set called "data3".
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names in a data set called "data4". 
5. From the data4, creates "data5", independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
6. Prints data5

IMPORTANT: Need to load "dplyr" package before running script.
